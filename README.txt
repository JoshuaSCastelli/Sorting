Sorting Project
Joshua Castelli

Project #1 Instructions:

1 - Load .sln file into visual studio(I used VS2017).

2 - Before we compile and run check that the files to be sorted and 
	the already sorted files are located in the following directories:

		"SortingProject/SortingProject/permuted"
		"SortingProject/SortingProject/sorted"
	
	**I changed the name of the files to make them more modular. In each**
	**directory there are files "30k.txt", "60k.txt"...etc without the  **
	**'perm' or 'sorted' prefix. Feel free to check that the files have **
	**NOT been modified, only the name.									**
		
	Please make sure these files are in the correct place, otherwise the 
	results will be undesired.
	
	Also check the following:
	
		"SortingProject/SortingProject/finishedFiles/heap/"
		"SortingProject/SortingProject/finishedFiles/insertion/"
		"SortingProject/SortingProject/finishedFiles/merge/"
	
	These directories each should have subdirectories "permuted" and "sorted"
	which should be empty until you run program.
	
	**For optimal results make sure you're debugging in "release" mode.**
	
3 - Compile and run the program by clicking "Local Windows Debugger".
	Follow the on screen prompts to get the desired results.
	When the program says "Finished" is when you know you can exit 
	the program or check that the file has been sorted in its 
	corresponding directory.
	
4 - Follow the prompt to either run program from beginning or exit.
